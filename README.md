# Weed-Detector-Muliti-level-image-classifier-


This is 7th week assignment of siraj make money with AI course.

Download the source dataset from 
https://www.kaggle.com/fpeccia/weed-detection-in-soybean-crops
This is an classification problem where our Deep Learning model will classify the type of soybean weed from the given dataset.

To run this project, run the Weed_Detection.ipynb file in either Jupyter notebook or in Google Colabs notebook using Pthon 3 environment.
Enter your kaggle credentials by downloading the credentials file from the kaggle website using Google colaboratory notebook.

This project is an classic example on how to use transfer learning with our own Convolutional neural network.
We are extending InceptionV3 model by adding our own layers to predict the Soybean weed images.
